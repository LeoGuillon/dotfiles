# Espanso

text expander written in Rust :â€¯[espanso](https://espanso.org/)

## Command rules

general personal rules for writting expanders :

- `:` is the default keycharacter, mostly for commands and symbols
- `,` stands for short expressions ; currently used mainly for quick chat messages
- no symbols for spellcheck

## App-specific config

- in the terminal, try to enable only commands starting with `:`
- in messaging apps (e.g. Beeper, Discord and MatterMost), disable emojis as these are already provided natively
